# CBManager Class Reference 
###### (SDK version 2.0 - 01/16/15)

## Overview
The CBManager class handles connections and data transfer between Braniac hardware accessory and iOS device (iPhone 4s and higher).

## List of development tools and frameworks used
#### Development tools and language: 
* Xcode 6.1+ 
* Objective-C
Frameworks for SDK:
* CoreBluetooth
* Accelerate
#### Frameworks for test project:
* CoreText
* Fabric
* Security
* OpenGLES
* QuartzCore
* Cocoapods

## Instructions on how to build and install for development CBManager Accessory Manager
First, copy to your project files CBManager.h, CBManager.m, SERVICES.h. Add next frameworks libraries to project: 

* CoreBluetooth
* Accelerate

Make your view controller which you want to use to receive data from CBManager inherited from CBManagerDelegate. Create instance variable of CBManager class and assign delegate property to self.
 
		CBManager *cbManager = [[CBManager alloc] init];
		cbManager.delegate = self;
		[cbManager start]; // 

or 

		[cbManager startTestSequenceWithDominantFrequence:selectedFreq]; where selectedFreq - float variable with test dominant frequency. 

Next you should implement required CB_dataUpdatedWithDictionary method to receive data from Brainiac accessory device. Example: 

		-(void)CB_dataUpdatedWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)data
		{

		    		//process data
       
		}

Also you may implement two optional methods (to receive FFT data, indicators state and status messages from device) 

		-(void)CB_fftDataUpdatedWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)data
		{
    		//process fft data
    
		}

		-(void)CB_indicatorsStateWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)data
		{		
    		//process indicators data
		}

		-(void)CB_changedStatus:(CBManagerMessage)status message:(NSString *)statusMessage
		{
    		dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        
        		self.lblStatus.text = statusMessage;
    		});
		}

## Tasks

#### Getting the CBManager Accessory Manager
    CBManager *cbManager = [[CBManager alloc] init];
    cbManager.delegate = self;

#### Starting and Stopping Connection and Data Streams
* start
* stop
* startTestSequenceWithDominantFrequence:
* startProcessAverageValues

#### Getting Information about CBManager state
* hasStarted *property*
* rawdata (NSMutableData *)
* raw values (NSMutableArray *)
* fftData (NSMutableArray *)
* batteryLevel (NSInteger)
* hasStartedIndicators *property*
* hasStartedProcessBasicValues *property*

#### Accessing the Delegate
* delegate *property*

## Properties

**hasStarted**

A BOOL value indicating if the current CBManager instance object working: connected to hardware Braniac accessory and receiving data. Read-only

		@property (nonatomic, assign, readonly) BOOL hasStarted;

**hasStartedProcessBasicValues**

A BOOL value indicating if the current CBManager instance object started to measure average values for current examinee indicators state. This state is needed before starting receiving real indicators state. Read-only

		@property (nonatomic, assign, readonly) BOOL hasStartedProcessBasicValues;

**hasStartedIndicators**

A BOOL value indicating if the current CBManager instance object started to measure indicators values for current examinee brain state. This property becomes true after some time (1 min) after starting measuring average basic values. When this property becomes true then delegate CB_indicatorsStateWithDictionary starts firing. Read-only

		@property (nonatomic, assign, readonly) BOOL hasStartedIndicators;

**rawdata**

A NSMutableData object containing the unprocessed raw data bytes received from hardware Braniac accessory. Read-only

		@property (strong, nonatomic, readonly) NSMutableData *rawdata;

**rawvalues**

A NSMutableArray object containing processed data values received from hardware Brainiac accessory including hardware order number, double values from each 4 channels, time tick order number. Read-only

		@property (strong, nonatomic, readonly) NSMutableArray *rawvalues;

**fftData**

A NSMutableArray object containing processed fast-FFT values made form each 256 raw data values for each channel. Includes FFT double values for each channel, serial order number and time tick value. Read-only

		@property (strong, nonatomic, readonly) NSMutableArray *fftData;

**batteryLevel**

A NSInteger value containing number from 0 to 100 indicating battery level of hardware accessory. Read-only

		-(NSInteger)batteryLevel;

**delegate**

The object that acts as the delegate (CBManagerDelegate) of the accessory. All data receiving and status reporting goes through it. 

		@property (nonatomic,strong) id <CBManagerDelegate> delegate;


## Initialisation and Creating CBManager object

**init**

Returns CBManager object which is ready to start connecting. Should always be used to start working with hardware Braniac accessory. 

		CBManager *cbManager = [[CBManager alloc] init];
		cbManager.delegate = self;

**start**

Starts connecting to hardware Braniac accessory and receiving data and processing data if connect is successful. Starts dispatching data via delegate methods immediately. Set hasStarted property to true.

		-(void)start;

**stop**
 
Stops sending data via delegate methods, disconnecting from hardware Braniac accessory. Set hasStarted property to false.

		-(void)stop;

**startTestSequenceWithDominantFrequence:**

Starts sending test data values via delegate methods (without using hardware accessory). Starts dispatching data via delegate methods immediately. Use this method to test correct data receiving sequences and draw sample data plots. Set hasStarted property to true.

		-(void)startTestSequenceWithDominantFrequence:(float)fréquence;

**startProcessAverageValues:**

Starts to measure basic average values needed to set start level before measuring brain activity and show state indicator. After 1 min after firing this method the delegate CB_indicatorsStateWithDictionary becomes firing (each 10 sec). 

		-(void)startProcessAverageValues;
